# Blank Web App Template

This repository serves as a blank template for making web applications with ASP.Net.  I've removed all the unnecessary fluff that comes with the default dotnet web app structure while leaving a working template structure intact.

In order to utilise this template to start your ASP.Net web app from an ideal starting point, simply clone or download the repo to your machine.  Ensuring you have the dotnet framework installed, prepare the dependencies with...

>dotnet restore

Compile the project with...

> dotnet build

Finally, to run it simply use

> dotnet run
