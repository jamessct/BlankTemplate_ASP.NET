# Handy Web App Template

This is a blank template for creating web applications with ASP.NET.  All the unnecessary fluff that comes with the default dotnet web app structure has been removed, while a simplified working template remains intact as the perfect starting point for a new web app.

To use this template: 

* Clone or download the repo to your machine.  
* Ensure you have the latest version of .NET Core SDK installed.  If not, a download for the installer can be found here: https://www.microsoft.com/net/core#windowscmd 

* Run the following commands:

`dotnet restore`
`dotnet build`

`dotnet run`

* Open 'localhost:5000' in your favourite browser.
