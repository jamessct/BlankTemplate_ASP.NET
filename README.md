# Blank Web App Template

This is a blank template for making web applications with ASP.Net.  All the unnecessary fluff that comes with the default dotnet web app structure has been removed, while a simplified working template remains intact.

To use this template: 

1. Clone or download the repo to your machine.  

2. Ensure you have the latest version of .NET Core SDK installed.  If not, a downlad for the windows command line can be found here: https://www.microsoft.com/net/core#windowscmd 

3. Run the following commands:

`dotnet restore`

`dotnet build`

`dotnet run`

4. Open 'localhost:5000' in your favourite browser.
